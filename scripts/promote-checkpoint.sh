# Usage: promote-checkpoint.sh <project-dir> <checkpoint-name> [<sha>]
#
# Promotes a sha to checkpoint/<name>. Defaults sha to HEAD. The script
# runs `git tag -f <tag> <sha>` directly — no orchestrator/electron
# involvement — so it's safe to use from CI or a terminal while the app
# is open, as long as you know what you're doing.
