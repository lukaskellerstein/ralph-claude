# Ralph-Claude: Autonomous Software Engineering at Scale

## The Problem

AI coding assistants today operate in one of two modes: **interactive** (human drives every prompt) or **single-shot** (one task, one context window, done). Neither scales to building real software — projects with dozens of features, thousands of files, and days of work.

The fundamental challenges:

1. **Context window exhaustion** — A 200K token window fills fast. After ~100K tokens of accumulated tool calls, code reads, and reasoning, the model enters a "dumb zone" where output quality degrades. Long-running sessions produce increasingly poor code.

2. **No persistent memory across sessions** — Each new conversation starts from zero. The agent re-discovers project structure, re-reads the same files, and makes the same mistakes it already learned to avoid.

3. **No structured planning** — Agents jump straight to implementation. Without a specification-first workflow, features are incomplete, inconsistent, and don't compose well across a multi-feature project.

4. **No verification beyond "it compiles"** — Most AI workflows stop at `tsc --noEmit` or `npm test`. Nobody checks if the feature actually works in a browser, if the UI renders correctly, or if the user flow makes sense.

5. **No recovery from failure** — When an agent gets stuck or produces bad code, the only option is human intervention. There's no automatic re-planning, no failure tracking, no self-correction loop.

6. **No cost or progress visibility** — The agent runs in a terminal. You watch scrolling text and hope for the best. No dashboards, no phase tracking, no cost attribution.

## The Three Pillars

Ralph-Claude synthesizes three independent innovations into a unified system:

### Pillar 1: Ralph Wiggum — The Loop Philosophy

[Ralph Wiggum](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) by Geoffrey Huntley is a deceptively simple idea: run `while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude ; done` in a bash loop. Each iteration gets a fresh context window, picks the most important task, implements it, commits, and exits. The loop restarts. Over hours and days, the project converges toward completeness through iteration.

**Key insights we inherit:**
- **Context isolation** — fresh context per unit of work prevents quality degradation
- **Self-improvement** — `AGENTS.md` accumulates operational learnings across iterations
- **"Signs" system** — numbered guardrails (999, 9999, 99999...) enforce invariants with escalating priority
- **Subagent control** — 500 parallel subagents for reads, 1 for builds (backpressure)
- **Trust the loop** — eventual consistency through iteration, not perfection per step

**What Ralph lacks:** No UI, no structured specs, no programmatic control, no abort, no cost tracking, no recovery logic. It's a bash script.

### Pillar 2: GitHub Spec-Kit — Structured Planning

[Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) by GitHub implements Specification-Driven Development (SDD) — specs are the primary artifact, code is generated output. It provides a templated workflow:

```
/speckit.constitution → /speckit.specify → /speckit.plan → /speckit.tasks → /speckit.implement
```

Each command produces structured artifacts:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `constitution.md` | Immutable project-wide principles |
| `spec.md` | Feature specification with user stories, acceptance criteria |
| `plan.md` | Technical implementation plan, architecture decisions |
| `research.md` | Technology decisions and rationale |
| `data-model.md` | Entities, relationships, schemas |
| `contracts/` | API contracts, interface definitions |
| `tasks.md` | Dependency-ordered, actionable task list |

**Key insights we inherit:**
- **Specs before code** — forces thorough thinking before implementation
- **Constitution** — project-wide constraints that shape all feature specs consistently
- **Phased execution** — each phase has focused scope, testable output
- **Acceptance-driven testing** — tests derived from acceptance criteria, not invented ad-hoc

**What Spec-Kit lacks:** No autonomous loop, no gap analysis, no failure recovery, no self-improvement. It's a sequential workflow that requires human orchestration.

### Pillar 3: Claude Agent SDK — Programmatic Control

The [Claude Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript) provides programmatic access to Claude Code instances via the `query()` API:

```typescript
const result = await query({
  prompt: "implement the auth module",
  options: {
    allowedTools: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash"],
    settingSources: ["project"],
    maxTurns: 200,
    hooks: { PreToolUse: [...], PostToolUse: [...] }
  }
});
```

**Key insights we inherit:**
- **Typed hooks** — intercept every tool call, subagent spawn, and completion event
- **Session management** — resume, fork, and abort running agents
- **`settingSources`** — automatically loads `.claude/rules/` including learnings from prior iterations
- **MCP integration** — browser automation, playwright, custom tools
- **AbortController** — graceful mid-phase cancellation

**What the SDK lacks:** No loop, no planning, no specs, no UI. It's a library.

## The Synthesis: Ralph-Claude

Ralph-Claude combines these three pillars into an autonomous software engineering system that can take a vague description and build a complete project over hours or days — without human intervention.

```

### How Context Isolation Works

Every box in the loop above is a **separate `query()` call** — a fresh Claude Code instance with a clean 200K context window. This is the core Ralph Wiggum insight, implemented programmatically:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant Q1 as query() #1
    participant Q2 as query() #2
    participant Q3 as query() #3
    participant Q4 as query() #4
    participant FS as Filesystem

    Note over O: Cycle N starts
    O->>Q1: Gap Analysis prompt + full_plan.md
    Q1->>FS: Read specs, code, tasks.md
    Q1-->>O: NEXT_FEATURE: auth-module

    O->>Q2: /speckit.specify "auth-module"
    Q2->>FS: Write specs/001-auth-module/spec.md
    Q2-->>O: Done

    O->>Q3: /speckit.plan specs/001-auth-module
    Q3->>FS: Read spec.md, write plan.md + tasks.md
    Q3-->>O: Done

    O->>Q4: /speckit.implement Phase 1
    Q4->>FS: Read tasks.md, implement, run tests
    Q4-->>O: Done (3 tasks completed)

    Note over O: Each query() = fresh 200K context
    Note over O: Learnings persist via filesystem
```

State doesn't pass through the context window — it passes through the **filesystem**. Specs, tasks, code, and learnings are written to disk. Each new `query()` reads what it needs from disk, operates in the "smart zone" of its context window, and writes results back. This is how Ralph Wiggum achieves eventual consistency: not by remembering everything, but by reading the current state each time.

### The Four-Way Gap Analysis

The gap analysis stage is the loop's brain. It reads `full_plan.md` (the user's original intent) and compares it against the current state of specs and code, then outputs exactly one decision:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    GAP[Gap Analysis] --> CHECK{Feature has\nspec dir?}
    CHECK -->|No| NF["NEXT_FEATURE\nCreate new spec"]
    CHECK -->|Yes| TASKS{All tasks\ncomplete?}
    TASKS -->|"Yes, all done"| NEXT{More features\nin full_plan.md?}
    TASKS -->|No| VALID{Tasks still\nvalid?}
    VALID -->|Yes| RF["RESUME_FEATURE\nContinue where left off"]
    VALID -->|No| RP["REPLAN_FEATURE\nRegenerate plan + tasks"]
    NEXT -->|Yes| CHECK
    NEXT -->|No| GC["GAPS_COMPLETE\nTerminate loop"]

    style NF fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff
    style RF fill:#f59e0b,color:#000
    style RP fill:#ef4444,color:#fff
    style GC fill:#10b981,color:#fff
```

This handles the full feature lifecycle: creation, resumption after crash, recovery from bad plans, and graceful termination. Ralph Wiggum's bash loop can only create and continue — it can't detect when a plan is wrong and needs regeneration.

### Self-Improvement Loop

Learnings accumulate in `.claude/rules/learnings.md` and are automatically loaded by every subsequent `query()` call via the SDK's `settingSources: ["project"]` mechanism:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q1["query() Cycle 1"] -->|discovers| L1["Learning: 'npm test requires\n--experimental-vm-modules flag'"]
    L1 -->|writes| FILE[".claude/rules/learnings.md"]
    FILE -->|auto-loaded via\nsettingSources| Q2["query() Cycle 2"]
    Q2 -->|discovers| L2["Learning: 'auth module uses\nargon2 not bcrypt'"]
    L2 -->|appends| FILE
    FILE -->|auto-loaded| Q3["query() Cycle 3"]

    style FILE fill:#a855f7,stroke:#7c3aed,color:#fff
```

This is functionally identical to Ralph Wiggum's `AGENTS.md` updates, but uses the SDK's native config loading instead of explicit file reads in the prompt.

### Backpressure Architecture

Multiple layers of verification prevent the agent from claiming work is done when it isn't:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Per-Task Backpressure (during implement)"
        T1[Implement task] --> BUILD1[Run build]
        BUILD1 -->|fail| FIX1[Fix & retry]
        FIX1 --> BUILD1
        BUILD1 -->|pass| TEST1[Run tests]
        TEST1 -->|fail| FIX2[Fix & retry]
        FIX2 --> TEST1
        TEST1 -->|pass| MARK["Mark task [x]"]
    end

    subgraph "Per-Feature Verification (after all tasks)"
        MARK --> VBUILD[Build entire project]
        VBUILD --> VTEST[Run full test suite]
        VTEST --> E2E["Browser E2E\n(Playwright/CDP)"]
        E2E --> SCREENSHOT[Take screenshots\nVerify UI flows]
    end

    subgraph "Loop-Level Safeguards"
        SCREENSHOT -->|pass| LEARNINGS[Update learnings]
        SCREENSHOT -->|fail 3x| REPLAN[Force REPLAN_FEATURE]
        REPLAN -->|fail 3x| SKIP[Skip feature\nLog to learnings]
    end

    style E2E fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff
    style REPLAN fill:#ef4444,color:#fff
    style SKIP fill:#6b7280,color:#fff
```

Key innovation over Ralph: **browser-based E2E verification**. Ralph only runs build + typecheck. Ralph-Claude opens the app in a browser (via MCP tools), walks user flows, takes screenshots, and verifies the UI actually works. This catches an entire class of bugs — rendering issues, broken interactions, missing styles — that compile-and-test backpressure misses.

### Acceptance-Driven Test Derivation

Tests aren't invented ad-hoc. They flow from acceptance criteria through the spec-kit pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    AC["Acceptance Criteria\n(spec.md)"] -->|/speckit.plan| RT["Required Tests\n(plan.md)"]
    RT -->|/speckit.tasks| TT["Test Tasks\n(tasks.md)"]
    TT -->|/speckit.implement| CODE["Tests + Code\n(implementation)"]
    CODE -->|backpressure| VERIFY["All tests must pass\nbefore task marked [x]"]

    style AC fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff
    style VERIFY fill:#10b981,color:#fff
```

This creates a traceable chain from "what the user wants" to "what the tests verify." An agent can't mark a task complete without implementing and passing the tests derived from its acceptance criteria.

### Core Engine Design

The core engine (`src/core/`) is **platform-agnostic** — pure Node.js with no Electron imports. It can be tested standalone, embedded in a CLI, or run as a service. The Electron app is just one possible frontend.

Three execution modes:

| Mode | Entry Point | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| `build` | `runBuild()` | Implement existing specs (single pass) |
| `plan` | `runBuild()` | Generate plans for existing specs |
| `loop` | `runLoop()` | Full autonomous loop (Phase A + B) |

### Data Flow

```mermaid

        TASKS["specs/NNN-feature/tasks.md"]
        CODE["src/**/* (implementation)"]

    LEARN -.->|auto-loaded| SPEC

    style FP fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff
    style LEARN fill:#a855f7,color:#fff
```

Key design decision: **`full_plan.md` is immutable**. The loop never modifies it. It captures the user's original intent from Phase A. Individual feature specs (derived from it) are mutable — they can be replanned, rewritten, and iterated on. This prevents drift from user intent while allowing the loop to self-correct at the feature level.

## Why This Approach Is Superior

### vs. Interactive AI Coding (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code manual)

|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Context strategy** | Single long session | Fresh context per stage (Ralph philosophy) |
| **Planning depth** | Varies, usually shallow | Spec-kit's full specify → plan → tasks pipeline |

| **Spec integration** | None | Native spec-kit with constitution |

## Key Innovation: Interactive Clarification

Neither Ralph Wiggum nor any other autonomous coding approach solves the **specification quality problem**: garbage in, garbage out. If the agent starts with a vague description, it builds the wrong thing — and burns budget doing it.

Ralph-Claude's Phase A is a thorough interactive session that transforms a vague idea into a comprehensive plan:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    VAGUE["'Build me a task management app'"] --> Q1["What's the tech stack?\nReact + Node + PostgreSQL"]
    Q1 --> Q2["What auth? OAuth, email/password, both?\nOAuth with Google + GitHub"]
    Q2 --> Q3["Real-time updates? WebSockets?\nYes, for team collaboration"]
    Q3 --> Q4["Deployment target?\nDocker on AWS ECS"]
    Q4 --> Q5["Testing strategy?\nJest + Playwright E2E"]
    Q5 --> CHECK{Completeness\nChecklist}

    CHECK -->|"User stories?"| Q6["At least one per feature\nwith acceptance criteria"]
    CHECK -->|"Data model?"| Q7["Users, Teams, Projects,\nTasks, Comments"]
    CHECK -->|"Build commands?"| Q8["npm run build,\nnpm test, npm run dev"]

    Q6 --> FP
    Q7 --> FP
    Q8 --> FP

    FP[".specify/full_plan.md\n200+ lines of structured context\nReady for autonomous execution"]

    style VAGUE fill:#ef4444,color:#fff
    style FP fill:#10b981,color:#fff
```

The completeness checklist ensures the plan has everything needed for autonomous execution:
- At least one user story with acceptance criteria per feature
- Technology stack with specific versions
- Build, test, and dev server commands
- Deployment target
- Testing strategy with specific tools
- Data model overview

Only when all items are covered does Phase B begin. This front-loads the human effort into a 30-minute clarification session, then the loop runs for hours without needing input.

## Summary

Ralph-Claude is the convergence of three ideas:

1. **Ralph Wiggum's loop philosophy** — context isolation, self-improvement, eventual consistency through iteration
2. **Spec-Kit's structured planning** — specifications before code, constitution-governed, acceptance-driven testing
3. **Claude Agent SDK's programmatic control** — typed hooks, abort management, MCP integration, session control

The result: a desktop application that takes a project description, clarifies it into a complete plan, and autonomously builds, verifies, and iterates — feature by feature, phase by phase — with fresh context windows, structured specs, browser-based verification, automatic failure recovery, and real-time visibility into every step.
